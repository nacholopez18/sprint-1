            I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i
            got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for meny years before i joined the boopcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro curse and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and mos grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the

            Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend! ”
